# HTML and CSS have simple syntax
- It's very repetitive, so we start rememberting the basics.

## Challenge #1: Starting of with a blank file
- Create a blank HTML file with the corect file name
- Add all the required elements so that we can start adding some content (very basic needed; 'content' elements like <header> <main> not needed)

#### Tips:
- We need to tell the browser what thype of document it is first
- We need somewhere for the "metadata" to live
- We need somewhere for the content to live

## Challenge #2: Add 2 lists to the page
- The ordered list should be added inside the sidebar.
- The unordered list should be added where indicated inside of main content.

#### Tips:
- The structure of both lists is the same, with one key difference between the two
- Don't forget, each item in the list needs to be wrapped in a specific tag

## Challenge #3: Fix the image on the page 
- I have added an image to the page, but I have made a mistake and it's not loading in...
- There might be more than 1 thing that's wrong
- There's somthing important missing, even once you get the image to load in 


#### Tips:
- The images are in a sub folder
- We need a way for a screen reader to know what the image is.
