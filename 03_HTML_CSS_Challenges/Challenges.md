# HTML and CSS have simple syntax
- It's very repetitive, so we start rememberting the basics.

## Challenge #1: Starting of with a blank file
- Create a blank HTML file with the corect file name
- Add all the required elements so that we can start adding some content (very basic needed; 'content' elements like <header> <main> not needed)

#### Tips:
- We need to tell the browser what thype of document it is first
- We need somewhere for the "metadata" to live
- We need somewhere for the content to live

## Challenge #2: Add 2 lists to the page
- The ordered list should be added inside the sidebar.
- The unordered list should be added where indicated inside of main content.
